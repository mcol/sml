SML
Structure-Conveying Modelling Language

Detailed installation instructions can be found in doc/userguide.pdf, the
file INSTALL provides generic instructions generated by automake.

SML is a modelling language library, to actually use it you will need a solver
interface. Two such programs are supplied with SML:
* interfaces/mps/smlmps will write out an MPS file containing the problem and
   is primarily intended as an example to implementors of other interfaces
* interfaces/oops/smloops provides an interface to the solver OOPS, a limited
   version of which is supplied with SML.

In order to run a problem you will need two files, one containing the model
and one containing the data. You should then run as
   smloops model.mod data.dat
which will then print the objective value to the screen and write the values
of the primal and dual variables to a file solution.sol
